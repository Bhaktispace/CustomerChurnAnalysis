# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Business Problem
A leading e-commerce company is experiencing customer churn, which negatively impacts revenue and long-term customer value. To address this, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns in city tier, preferred payment mode, login devices, satisfaction score and many more . The goal of this analysis is to identify key indicators of churn, provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies, and propose future predictive modeling projects to proactively address churn risks.
